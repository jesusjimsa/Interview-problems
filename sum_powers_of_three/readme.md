# Description

Given an integer `n`, return `true` if it is possible to represent `n` as the sum of distinct powers of three. Otherwise, return `false`.

An integer `y` is a power of three if there exists an integer `x` such that `y == 3^x`.

## Example 1:
```
Input: n = 12
Output: true
Explanation: 12 = 3^1 + 3^2
```

## Example 2:
```
Input: n = 91
Output: true
Explanation: 91 = 3^0 + 3^2 + 3^4
```

## Example 3:
```
Input: n = 21
Output: false
```

## Constraints:

* `1 <= n <= 10^7`
