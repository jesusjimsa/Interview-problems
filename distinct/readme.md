# Description

Write a function
```python
def solution(A)
```

that, given an array `A` consisting of `N` integers, returns the number of distinct values in array `A`.

For example, given array `A` consisting of six elements such that:
```python
 A[0] = 2    A[1] = 1    A[2] = 1
 A[3] = 2    A[4] = 3    A[5] = 1
```

the function should return `3`, because there are `3` distinct values appearing in array `A`, namely `1`, `2` and `3`.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

* `N` is an integer within the range `[0..100,000]`;
* Each element of array `A` is an integer within the range `[-1,000,000..1,000,000]`.
